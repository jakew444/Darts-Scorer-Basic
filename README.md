# Darts-Scorer-Basic

Darts Scorer Basic is the first application I ever created. 

It's a application that takes user input allowing them to score their darts matches. 

The user selects the number of legs they wish to play using the radio buttons,
then the users can submit their scores using the player one and player two boxes and buttons,
once on of the users reaches the winning number of legs selected they are declared the winner.

I have since written a much more advanced darts scoring application, please view my Darts-Scorer-2.0 repository the see the advancements I was able to make as my coding techniques improved.
